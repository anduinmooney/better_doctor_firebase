#### By _**Anduin Mooney**_

## Description

_This is a WIP application that will grab the users location and show doctors in their area using the BetterDoctor API_

## App Specifications & Development Details

_This part of the README is desgined to help both the user and I to understand the kind of application I'm developing, the development process, and what still needs to be implemented (and how I will implement them) based on certain guidelines_


### Development Schedule

_As I mentioned above, this project is going to have a 4 week development cycle, which the outlines for each week will be listed below._

* _Week 1: UI, UX, storing inputs and navigation_
* _Week 2: Tracking and Collecting Objects from an API_
* _Week 3: User authentication and firebase_
* _Week 4: Currenty unknown until I progress_

## Installation
* _Clone repository from github_
* _Open repository file with Android Studio (3.0.1 is preferred, or else there may be errors)_
* _Create a virtual android device (Make sure it runs on marshmallow API23)_
* _Create a gradle.properties file_
* _Get an API token from https://developer.betterdoctor.com/_
* _Insert token inside gradle.properties file as "DoctorToken = "YOUR-API-TOKEN-HERE""_
* _For input, please use a state abbreviation such as WA or wa. You're also welcome to add a city after for more specific results. EX: or-portland, wa-vancouver, ca-anaheim_

## Known Bugs


_For some reason, the api call will randomly not work. This seems to happen 1/4th-1/5th of the time, and I'm currently looking for a workaround_
